From https://www.noao.edu/meetings/eventful-universe/Thursday0318/morning/CRTS_TucsonMar10.pdf :
Discovery rate ~ 1 transient per 10^6 sources detected per epoch So, transient discovery seems very rare. 

Each object contains a semi-random number of observations (2-10). Observations come in tuples of (time (seconds), light (no idea)). 
Objects are arrays of these tuples where the first index is the first observation taken.
